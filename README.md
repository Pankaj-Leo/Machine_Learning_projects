ðŸ“˜ Machine Learning Algorithms & Workflows

This repository is a collection of machine learning implementations, notebooks, and workflows, covering supervised, unsupervised, and deep learning models. It also includes supporting modules for data exploration, time-series analysis, anomaly detection, and MLOps (MLflow, DagsHub, BentoML).

The repo is organized into modular folders â€” each focusing on a specific algorithm or concept.
